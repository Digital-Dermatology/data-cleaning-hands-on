# Data Cleaning Tutorial

Modern data cleaning approaches will be presented, explained, and critically reviewed with a focus on emerging tools for image dataset curation.
Automatic detection of data quality issues in data collections of growing size will be motivated by reviewing contamination in popular benchmarks and by assessing its impact on the training and evaluation of machine learning models.
Data cleaning will be shown to be complementary to learning with noise, although it is not quite as known.
Particular attention will be paid to near-duplicate images, which can lead to train-evaluation data leaks, irrelevant samples, which are invalid within their context, and label errors, which corrupt the learning signal.
The major repositories containing resources for data cleaning will be presented with their strengths and weaknesses, used in guided examples, and participants will be encouraged to clean their own datasets in the closing part of the tutorial.
